A project completed through the course of SWEN302 at Victoria University. The aim was create an application for a client, in my case it was to create a framework that allows multiple devices for maintaining and measuring different things in the bathroom such as teeth brushing, weight and shaving.

This was achieved using different devices such as a Wii Fit board, an Android device and a local webserver that maintained all this data coming in.
