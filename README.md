# ENGR302 MirrorMirror

MirrorMirror is a personal analytics tool that will help users track personal 
data about themselves primarily through a "smart mirror" in replacement of their 
current mirror.

The application will consist of two main components, one being the mirror 
(an android tablet), and the other being the web application.

The mirror will be used primarily for the collection of data be it via camera,
other sensors, or non-trivial user input, and the web application will be
the hub for user analysis, displaying the user's interactions with the app over
time through graphs, charts, photo comparisons, statistics, etc.
